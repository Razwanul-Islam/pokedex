## About the Project

As an anime enthusiast and a big fan of Pok√©mon, I wanted to recreate the magic of the Pok√©dex in the real world. This web app takes an image input and uses an LLM to provide fun, Pok√©mon-like information about the object in the picture.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload any image of a real-world object or living thing.
- **Pok√©mon Description**: Get a generated description as if the object were a Pok√©mon.
- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Fast Processing**: Quick response times using the Gemini-1.5-flash LLM.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Django, Django Rest Framework
- **AI Model**: Gemini-1.5-flash LLM (via Google's free API)
